This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## UI Dependecies & Library
Sure, let's expand on each package mentioned in your project documentation:

### Dependencies

- **Node.js **: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's essential for running and building JavaScript applications outside the browser.

- **Yarn **: Yarn is a package manager that securely installs dependencies. It's similar to npm but often chosen for its speed and reliability.

### Frameworks and Libraries

- **React **: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.

- **Next.js **: Next.js is a React framework for building server-rendered applications. It simplifies the setup of React applications with features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and easy configuration.

- **AppRouter **: Assuming this refers to a custom or specific router setup for your application. Routers manage navigation and URL updates in single-page applications (SPA).

- **TypeScript **: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It helps catch errors early through static type checking.

- **ESLint **: ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript and TypeScript code. It's used to enforce coding styles and best practices.

### UI Libraries

- **Tailwind CSS **: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs. It provides low-level utility classes to style your components.

- **Shadcn UI **: Assuming this is a UI library or component framework that includes additional UI components or utilities beyond what's in Tailwind CSS.

- **Lucid Icons **: Lucid Icons is likely an icon library providing a collection of SVG icons for use in your application.

- **Heroicons **: Heroicons is another icon library, often used in conjunction with Tailwind CSS, providing a set of customizable SVG icons.

### Authentication

- **NextAuth.js **: NextAuth.js is a complete authentication solution for Next.js applications. It supports various authentication providers (e.g., OAuth, JWT) out of the box.

### Validation

- **Zod **: Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It allows you to define data schemas and validate data against those schemas.

## Setup Instructions

### Package Usage

- **Node.js and Yarn**: Required for development and running scripts.
- **React and Next.js**: Foundation for building the frontend application with server-side rendering capabilities.
- **AppRouter**: Manages routing within the application for navigation purposes.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances JavaScript with types for better code readability and maintainability.
- **ESLint**: Enforces coding standards and identifies potential errors in JavaScript and TypeScript code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first CSS classes for styling components.
- **Shadcn UI**: Additional UI components or utilities for enhancing the UI beyond Tailwind CSS.
- **Lucid Icons and Heroicons**: SVG icon libraries for visual elements in the application.
- **NextAuth.js**: Handles authentication flows, integrating with various authentication providers.
- **Zod**: Defines and validates data schemas, ensuring data integrity and type safety.

This expanded documentation should provide a clearer understanding of each dependency's role and purpose within this app (Next.js) project.
